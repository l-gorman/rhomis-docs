What is RHoMIS?
===================================================

The Rural Household Multi-Indicator Survey (RHoMIS) has been
widely used since 2015. RHoMIS consists of a suite of tools designed to
collect harmonised and interoperable data on smallholder farmers. Since 2020, the 
RHoMIS team have been working on new version of RHoMIS. We have focused on automation,
to help the wider community build their own surveys, process their own data, and contriubte
to the wider development of RHoMIS. 

The new version of RHoMIS consists of a set of interoperable tools 
used to simplify survey design, data management, and data processing. The main components are:

#. **Management Console**: An application to manage survey forms, collaborators, and data. 
#. **Survey Builder**: A tool to build surveys, drawing on a bank of survey modules.
#. **Data collection and management software**: We use `ODK Collect  <https://docs.getodk.org/collect-intro/>`_ to collect data, `ODK Central <https://docs.getodk.org/central-intro/>`_ to manage survey uploads. 
#. **Data Processing Tools**: We want to make data processing and analysis as simple as possible. We have made made an R-package, for you to conduct your own analyses. This package is also used to process the data, made accessible in the management console described above.


To get an overview of how to use RHoMIS 2.0, we recommend starting with our :ref:`quickstart_guide`.
This will take you through the process of creating an account, building surveys, collecting data, and 
downloading you processed data for a simple example project. 

For a more in depth look at each of the components, you can navigate through each section using the sidebar 
(if you are using the online documentation) or using the table of contents (if you are using the pdf documentation). 
In each section you will find further details on the individual RHoMIS 2.0 components.
