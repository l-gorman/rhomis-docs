Building a Survey
===========================

The design of a survey takes place in 4 main stages:

1. **Initialisation**: Name your project/questionnaire
2. **Build**: Build a survey by selecting predefined modules
3. **Localisation**: Selecting choices which are appropriate for the location where you will conduct your survey
4. **Review**: Work with and modify your survey, either by testing it with people or by generating synthetic data



1. Initialising your Project
#######################################

When you visit the survey builder, you will see a form
which looks like the one below. Here you will enter 
information on the questionnaire you are building. You
will first need to select a project name, a form name, 
and enter some metadata about how you intend to use 
the survey. Once you have finished entering the metadata,
press "Save and Continue".

.. admonition:: Projects and Forms

    Projects and forms are a useful way to 
    organise your questionnaires. 

    - **Projects** can contain many forms. It can be helpful to store related forms within a project. 
    - **Forms** are the questionnaires themselves. 



.. sidebar:: Modules

    Core modules are used in most RHoMIS survey, they are essential
    for calculating key indicators such as household size, income, 
    food security, and dietary diversity. 

    Additional modules are available to add to the questionnaire. They 
    include more specific questions on specialist topics. See the 
    :download:`RHoMIS Module Booklet <../files/rhomis_modules_booklet.pdf>`
    for more information

2. Designing Your Questionnaire
#######################################


During the questionnaire design, you can select from a 
set of premade modules. Core modules are preselected for 
you. Available modules can be added by dragging from 
"available modules" (on the left), into "selected modules"
on the right.

A few things to keep in mind when building a survey:

- Keep as many core modules as possible. This will ensure you can calculate core indicators
- Try to keep the survey short, this will be less troublesome for the respondent and increase the likelihood of reliable answers
- Try to look at the modules in more detail, and see what would be a sensible order to ask the questions. You can view information on the modules, by clicking on them.

.. note::
    It can take a while for the survey to build and save!

3. Localising Your Questionnaire
#######################################

Once you have built your main survey, you can begin localise your 
questionnaire.

Location Information
**************************************

In each RHoMIS survey there is a metadata module. This collects 
information on the time and location of the interview. Enumerators
need a list of locations to choose from to ensure data quality.

During stage 1 of the customisation you can enter which locations 
the survey will be conducted. This can be changed at a later date.
We offer the ability to include 3 levels of region.

1. Top level: The administrative level just below country. Here we could select region, state, or county.
2. Mid level: The administrative level just below the top level. Here we could select subregion or district.
3. Lowest level: The smallest adminstrative unit in the sample (usually "village").

Download the location template and begin filling in. the table should 
look something like this:

.. list-table::

     - Village 3

Once you have filled it in, you will see an option to upload your location lists.

.. sidebar:: Localising Choices

    Localisation means making your survey
    relevant for the location you intend to
    conduct the survey.

    For example, with the question "What area of land is
    cultivated by your household?". It is useful to
    think of which options which will be most 
    meaningful for the respondents and the enumerators.
    Will "hectares" be meaningful for respondents
    in your location, or acres?

Choice Localisation
**************************************

You will need to verify several multiple
choice options. For each list, there are 
predefined options which have occure frequently
in RHoMIS surveys. For example, with "crop_sale_price_quantityunits",
common options include "total_income_per_year", "price_per_kg", "price_ber_bag_50kg",
and "price_per_tonne".

- **crop_list**: The list of crops grown
- **livestock_list**: The list of livestock kept
- **cropyield_units**: Common units in kg for the amount of crop harvested per year (e.g. sacks_10kg)
- **crop_sale_price_quantityunits**: Common units for crops sold (e.g. are crops often sold by sack, by box. If so, how much do these sacks roughly weigh?)
- **offfarm_incomes**: What sources of off-farm income are common
- **fert_units**: Common units for fertiliser (kg)
- **milk_units**: Common units form milk (litres)

.. warning:: 
    Only add customised elements after selecting some of the default options

4. Reviewing Your Questionnaire
#######################################

To review your survey we suggest 
:ref:`collecting some draft data <collect_draft_data>`.
By collecting draft data, you will be able to see how the 
survey flows and what the results will look like.

At any point, modify your form by returning to the home page.
Select "Manage Existing Projects". Select your project, select 
your form, and under options select "edit form".

Once you are happy with your form, you can finalise, and begin
collecting "real" data.

.. warning::
    Once your form it is built it will be saved as a draft.
    This allows you to collect mock data, and see what that 
    data will look like. 

    Once you are happy with your form you can finalise it.
    Finalising a form locks it in place, but will also delete
    draft entries.
