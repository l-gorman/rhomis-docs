Collecting Data
=======================================

Once you have built your survey, you are ready to start 
collecting data.

If you have just build a survey builder, there will be
a button to redirect you back to the "RHoMIS App". 

If you are working from the RHoMIS homepage, select "Manage Existing Projects", 
select your project, select your form, and under options select "collect data".


Installing ODK
#######################################

Data collection can be carried out using any Android device.
To install ODK, follow `these instructions <https://docs.getodk.org/collect-install/>`_

Filling in Data
#######################################

Draft Forms
--------------------------------------

It is useful to fill in data on draft forms to see
how the survey flows, and to make sure that data 
processing won't cause any errors. When you arrive
at "Collect Data" page, you can scan the QR code in the 
ODK collect app and start collecting data. 

If you want to to see what the data might look like,
you can also click the "generate data" button. This 
will generate random responses to show you the format 
of the data. This is also useful to practice 
:ref:`processing data <processing_data>`.


Finalized Forms
--------------------------------------

For finalized forms, you will be collecting
real data. Simply go to the "Collect Data" 
page, as shown above.
Scan the QR code in the ODK collect app and
start collecting data.
