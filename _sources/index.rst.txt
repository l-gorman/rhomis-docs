RHoMIS was designed to improve the process of gathering 
information from farming households in the rural developing world. 
Household surveys are very widely carried out, but the 
data is rarely comparable, and so the opportunities for 
learning between individual projects are limited. 
For these reasons, the tool balances standardisation with flexibility.
 
RHoMIS was also designed to reduce costs, time requirements, 
and reporting burdens for those who carry out household surveys. 
Internationally recognised indicators are used, and reflexive 
learning since 2015 has led to a smooth and rapid questionnaire, 
which gathers considerable detail in a relatively short amount of time.

The tool is designed to minimise the burden on the rural household, 
to maximise the reliability of responses, and to improve consistency 
between different studies.

Scientific Background
###################################

The RHoMIS tool has been built with a high level of scientific rigour. 
The survey includes proven and widely accepted indicators such as the 
Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES), the Household Dietary Diversity 
Score (HDDS),  the Hunger and Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS), 
Food Availabilty (FA), and the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI). 

Over 15 scientific papers about the tool have either been published or are in 
the process of being published. You can also view more matierials on `RHoMIS Scientific Output`_
